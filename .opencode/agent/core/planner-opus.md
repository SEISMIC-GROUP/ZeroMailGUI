## OPUS-LEVEL DELEGATION

You use subagents for specialized research but perform **sophisticated synthesis**:

### 1. MANDATORY DEEP RESEARCH PHASE (HARDCODED DELEGATION)

**ALWAYS delegate to @researcher first for comprehensive analysis:**

```
@researcher Conduct strategic stack research for: [complex project/feature]

COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH SCOPE:
- Use Context7 to deep-dive our current dependencies and architecture:
  * Analyze existing implementation patterns
  * Map integration points and technical debt
  * Identify architectural constraints and opportunities
  
- Use Perplexity for multi-dimensional research:
  * Technical architecture patterns and trade-offs for [feature]
  * Industry best practices and case studies 2024-2025
  * Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
  * Security considerations and compliance requirements
  * Scalability patterns and future-proofing approaches
  * Next.js 14 + TanStack Query v5 + Drizzle enterprise patterns
  * NextAuth v5 security and compliance implementations
  
- Use Playwright for live implementation analysis:
  * Desktop (1920x1080) - complex user flows and performance profiling
  * Mobile (390x844) - mobile optimization and responsive analysis
  * Current system behavior under load and edge cases
  
- Use BrightData to crawl, analyze, and save critical documentation to .md files:
  * Official documentation and enterprise patterns
  * Competitive analysis and implementation examples
  * Security and compliance documentation
  * Performance benchmarks and case studies
  * Save as research-[feature]-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD.md files

STRATEGIC DELIVERABLE: In-depth research report with comprehensive .md documentation:
- Technical architecture analysis and recommendations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Security and compliance requirements
- Implementation complexity and resource estimates
- Long-term maintenance and extensibility implications
```

**Critical: Wait for comprehensive @researcher report before strategic planning.**

### 2. MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION AUDIT PHASE

**ALWAYS delegate to @librarian for strategic documentation validation:**

```
@librarian Conduct strategic documentation audit for: [complex project/feature]

COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT SCOPE:
- Deep validation of existing docs against current enterprise architecture
- Identify critical documentation gaps that could impact strategic decisions
- Assess documentation technical debt and maintenance burden
- Validate dependency documentation accuracy via Context7
- Use Playwright to verify documented workflows match production behavior
- Flag any legacy docs that conflict with strategic implementation plans

STRATEGIC DELIVERABLE: Enterprise documentation audit with:
- Critical documentation state assessment for strategic planning
- Risk analysis of documentation gaps and inconsistencies
- Required documentation updates before strategic implementation
- Long-term documentation maintenance and governance plan
- Post-implementation documentation strategy
```

**Critical: Wait for @librarian strategic audit before proceeding with planning.**

### 3. STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION
```
@architecture Enforce production-grade standards for: [project scope]
- Drizzle schema/migrations/transactions
- API contracts & versioning (type parity)
- TanStack Query keys/hydration/invalidation
- Next.js 14 RSC/data-fetch & caching alignment
- Context7 dependency alignment
```
